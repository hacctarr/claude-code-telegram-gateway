# Claude Code Multi-Session Telegram Gateway (macOS)

A private, local-first gateway that connects your **iPhone** to the **Claude Code sessions running on your Mac** over **Telegram Forum Topics**. It works in both directions:

- **Desk → phone (live mirror):** run Claude normally in the native TUI on your Mac; every *active* session automatically gets its own Telegram topic, and the conversation (your desk input, Claude's replies, tool activity) mirrors into it within ~2s.
- **Phone → desk (inject):** reply inside a topic to steer that session. When the desk session is idle, your message runs headlessly and streams back live. This is ideal when you're **away from the desk**.

It is a transcript **watcher**, not a terminal scraper — it reads Claude's own session logs (`~/.claude/projects/**/<uuid>.jsonl`) and drives turns via headless `claude -p`. No `node-pty`, no ANSI parsing. Zero runtime dependencies.

## How it works

```
   ~/.claude/projects/<repo>/<uuid>.jsonl  (written by the native Claude TUI)
                    |
      [poll loop, every ~2s]
        ├─ active + no topic  → createForumTopic + opener      (auto-initiate)
        ├─ new transcript lines → mirror to the topic          (🖥️ desk / assistant / 🔧 tool)
        └─ idle 7 days        → closeForumTopic                 (prune)
                    ▲
  reply in a topic → idle? → claude -p --resume (streams back) │ busy? → queue, run when idle
  /new <msg>       → new topic + independent session
```

- **1 supergroup per repo** (`REPO_MAPPINGS`), **1 topic per session**, isolated end-to-end.
- A session's `cwd` (stored in its transcript) maps it to the right supergroup automatically.
- Session ↔ topic links persist in `links.json`, so topics survive restarts. `sessions.json` from
  older versions is migrated automatically on first run.

---

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with Node.js 18+ (tested on v26).
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and logged in (`claude` on your PATH).
- A Telegram bot that is a **group Admin with the "Manage Topics" permission** (required so the
  gateway can create/close topics). Without it, mirroring is skipped and you fall back to manually
  creating topics + `/resume`.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hacctarr/claude-code-telegram-gateway
cd claude-code-telegram-gateway
npm run setup          # interactive: validates your bot, auto-detects your
                       # user id + group chat id, writes config.json, and can
                       # install the background service for you
```

First create the bot + group (Telegram side) as in **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** — it takes ~2 minutes —
then `npm run setup` does the rest. Everything below is the manual equivalent.

## Setup (manual)

1. **Create a bot** via `@BotFather` (`/newbot`) and copy the HTTP API token.
2. **Create a Supergroup** per repo, enable **Topics**, add the bot, and promote it to
   **Admin → Manage Topics + Post Messages**.
3. **Get IDs:** your numeric user id (`@userinfobot`) and the group chat id (`-100…`, via the
   `getUpdates` URL in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)).
4. **Configure:** `cp config.example.json config.json` and fill it in:
   ```json
   {
     "BOT_TOKEN": "…",
     "ALLOWED_USER_IDS": ["<your_user_id>"],
     "REPO_MAPPINGS": { "-1001654782309": "/Users/you/Documents" },
     "CLAUDE_PATH": "/Users/you/.nvm/versions/node/vXX/bin/claude"
   }
   ```
   Optional keys (defaults shown): `MIRROR` (true), `AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS` (true),
   `SHOW_TOOL_ACTIVITY` (true), `PERMISSION_MODE` ("bypassPermissions"), `MODEL`,
   `IDLE_INJECT_SECONDS` (15), `ACTIVE_WINDOW_MIN` (30), `PRUNE_AFTER_DAYS` (7),
   `PRUNE_MODE` ("close" | "delete"), `POLL_MS` (2000).

> **Permissions — two ways to run it:**
> - **`bypassPermissions`** (default): phone-injected turns run tools without prompts. Anyone
>   allowed to post in the group gets unattended tool access to that repo — `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is
>   what protects it.
> - **Any stricter mode** (e.g. `"PERMISSION_MODE": "acceptEdits"` or `"manual"`): tool-permission
>   prompts appear **in the Telegram topic as ✅ Allow / ❌ Deny buttons** — tap to approve from your
>   phone (only `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` presses are honored). Unanswered requests deny after
>   `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300) so turns can't hang. Your configured allow/deny rules
>   still apply first; buttons appear only for what would genuinely prompt.

## Run

Foreground (for testing):
```bash
npm start
```

As a background service (auto-start on login, auto-restart on crash):
```bash
./install-service.sh      # loads a launchd agent, logs to gateway.log, adds a `cr` alias
tail -f gateway.log       # watch it live
./uninstall-service.sh    # stop + remove
```

`npm test` runs the unit suite (no network, no `claude` spawn).

---

## Using it

- **From the Mac:** just run `claude` in a mapped repo. Within ~30 min of activity a topic appears
  on your phone and mirrors the session live.
- **From the phone:**
  - Reply in a topic to steer that session (runs when the desk session is idle).
  - `/new <message>` — start a brand-new, independent session in its own topic.
  - `/new` (bare) — detach the current topic so your next message starts a fresh session there.
  - `/exit` (or `/close`) — close this topic and stop mirroring its session. The session stays
    resumable on disk, and fresh desk activity re-opens a topic for it automatically.
  - **`/desk`** — open this topic's session in the editor on your Mac (VS Code by default). The
    clean "hand it back to the desk" move: it opens the exact session so you continue there.
  - `/sessions` — list recent sessions in the repo.
  - `/resume <uuid | text>` — link this topic to an existing session (searches first message + content).
- **Back at the desk:** two ways, pick per moment —
  - **VS Code / editor:** tap **`/desk`** in the topic; the exact session opens in your editor on the
    Mac via a `vscode://` deep link (configurable for Cursor/Windsurf via `DESK_URL_TEMPLATE`).
  - **Terminal:** just open one — an auto-resume hook (installed into `~/.zshrc`) drops you into that
    branch, multi-repo aware, then clears itself. `cr` remains as a manual resume.

### Phone continuation — works whether or not the desk session is closed
- **Desk session closed:** your phone reply continues the *same* session and is saved — seamless,
  and `cr` at the Mac picks it right up.
- **Desk session left open:** the desk process owns the transcript, so a plain resume wouldn't
  persist. With `AUTO_FORK` (default on) the gateway instead **forks a saved phone branch** and the
  topic follows it — full context kept, one-line notice posted, desk copy untouched. If you later
  keep working the desk copy, it earns its own topic automatically. Three safeguards make this
  race-free (each was a real bug once):
  - held-detection runs **before** the turn (`lsof`, excluding the gateway's own pid) — the prompt
    and its tool side effects execute exactly once, and idle-but-open sessions aren't re-forked;
  - the fork's session id is **pre-minted and reserved**, so the poller can never create a
    duplicate topic for the branch mid-turn;
  - a reply resolves its target session **when it runs**, so back-to-back messages follow the
    first one's fork instead of forking the original twice.
  Set `AUTO_FORK: false` to disable; held-session replies then run with full context but aren't
  persisted (and say so).

### Other notes
- Mirror latency ≈ `POLL_MS` (~2s); it posts completed turns, not token-by-token (phone-injected
  turns *do* stream token-by-token via the live-edited message). Failing desk tool calls are
  surfaced as `⚠️ tool error`; successful tool output is kept quiet.
- **Stall/approval notices:** a desk permission prompt is editor-UI state and never appears in the
  transcript — from the phone the session just looks stuck. If a desk tool call stays unresolved
  past `STALL_NOTICE_SECONDS` (default 60, 0 = off), the topic gets a one-time notice naming the
  tool ("may be running long — or waiting for approval at the desk"), and a follow-up when it
  completes. Approval itself must happen at the desk; `/desk` jumps you there.
- With `bypassPermissions` (default), phone-injected turns never block on a tool-permission prompt.
  A clarifying question in Claude's reply just streams to you; answer in the topic to continue.
- A single-instance lock prevents two gateways from fighting over `getUpdates`. Linux users: a
  `systemd --user` unit is in `systemd/` (macOS uses the bundled launchd installer).
